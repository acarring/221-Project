dem	the trump admin brief arguing that the aca is unconstitutional is heartless andamp wrong any republican in congress who refuses to oppose the doj action is complicit in their efforts to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions andamp strip away health care from millions
dem	robert mueller report clearly identified several instances in which the president tried to remove the special counsel ag barr though did not include references to any of those instances in his initial public conclusions about the report
dem	now that we have been able to read the redacted report we know that it reveals significant troubling conduct by the president and members of his campaign
dem	the process and the timeline of attorney general barr handling of the mueller report matter they matter a lot after his misleading initial public conclusions the president spent three full weeks claiming that he would been fully exonerated
dem	no prosecutor worth their salt would make a decision about whether the president of the united states obstructed justice without reviewing the evidence attorney general barr lacks all credibility
dem	this should not have been a difficult question to answer
dem	congress has both the constitutional duty and the authority to investigate the serious findings contained in the mueller report i strongly believe this committee needs to hear directly from special counsel mueller
dem	the mueller report details episodes of president trump efforts to interfere in the investigation the president repeatedly told don mc gahn mueller has to go he then ordered mc gahn to release a false statement saying the president did not order mueller fired
dem	we can not take anything ag barr tells us today at face value until we hear directly from robert mueller we need the special counsel to testify publicly and soon
dem	attorney general barr admits to sen blumenthal that there are notes of his conversations with mueller but he refuses to turn them over to congress what are they hiding
dem	during the barr hearing senator mazie hirono asked attorney general barr if it was okay for a president to ask his white house counsel to lie the attorney general of the united states refused to answer
dem	it was extraordinary that atty gen. barr could not even acknowledge to me that it was troubling that the trump campaign was receptive to offers of assistance from russia really all americans should agree that foreign adversaries have no place in our elections
dem	i was left in disbelief when ag barr told me trump fully cooperated with mueller when trump refused to be interviewed andamp mueller documented numerous times trump tried to shut down the investigation that undermines investigations everywhere and is beneath mr. barr office
dem	for months i have been saying that trump hired barr to undermine the constitution and protect his presidency at all costs between his efforts to whitewash the mueller report and his performance in front of congress today he has more than lived up to that expectation
dem	watch senator leahy lays out how despite assertions to the contrary from attorney general barr the trump white house in no way fully cooperated with the mueller investigation barr hearing
dem	it is now clear to me that attorney general barr believes he has the president defense lawyer not the american people lawyer that is not the way this is supposed to work
dem	there are huge discrepancies between what ag barr said about the special counsel findings in the mueller report and what mueller wrote on issues as important as obstruction of justice we need special counsel mueller to testify
dem	letter just released by house judiciary even further proof that we deserve answers as to why ag barr misled the american people and tried to cover up trump efforts to obstruct the russia investigation
dem	i strongly believe that this committee needs to hear directly from special counsel mueller about his views on the report in his march letter sen feinstein at barr hearing
dem	watch now senate judiciary committee questions attorney general barr on the mueller report
dem	ag barr has many questions to answer by repeatedly skewing public perception of the mueller report in favor of pres trump he has been playing the role of defense attorney to the president instead of ag to the united states watch here as i ask him qs
dem	this is exactly why i said mr. barr should never have been confirmed in the first place at this point he has lost all credibility and the only way to clear this up is for mr. mueller to testify publicly
dem	ag barr has whitewashed the mueller report i believe it is clear he took the report findings and twisted them politically to the benefit of the president that is not barr role as attorney general and i do not believe he served the cause of justice
dem	ag barr has done a great disservice to the country acting as an agent for trump and spinning the mueller report in the president favor instead of being straight up with the american people we deserve answers at today hearing and barr must release mueller letter
dem	not that long ago senate republicans believed they had a constitutional duty to conduct oversight why are they giving president real donald trump a pass on everything

dem	president trump nomination of judge brett kavanaugh to the supreme court has been one of the saddest moments in the history of the senate when the history of the senate is written this chapter will be a flashing red warning light of what to avoid

dem	article of the constitution says that a supreme court justice shall hold office during good behavior what this body has been unwilling to do is actually determine whether or not judge kavanaugh has engaged in good behavior before he is put on the court sen markey
dem	in his time as a judge judge kavanaugh has consistently sided against americans who are trying to exercise their civil rights gillibrand ny
dem	i find this record deeply concerning it is evidence that if confirmed judge kavanaugh would take this country backwards reversing course on decades of hard-won progress sen tina smith

dem	president trump promised to only nominate individuals to the supreme court who would be pro-life and pro-gun nominees who would automatically overturn roe v. wade in my judgement judge kavanaugh clearly meets the test
dem	on every level brett kavanaugh has completely disqualified himself to sit on the highest court in our land the senate still has one final chance tomorrow to do the right thing i am praying that it will
dem	every american is entitled to the benefit of the doubt but nobody is entitled to a seat on the united states supreme court
dem	this was not a search for the truth instead this was about politics and raw power to push through an unfit nominee
dem	never before have we had a supreme court nominee where over of his record is hidden from the public never before have we had a nominee display flagrant partisanship and open hostility at a hearing and never before have we had a nominee facing allegations of sexual assault
dem	i believe judge kavanaugh extreme record on the bench stands in stark contrast to what the majority of americans want protections for those with pre-existing conditions the freedom for women to make their own health care decisions independent checks on executive power
dem	we expect presidents to look for the best candidates it is why the vetting process in the senate should be serious and thoughtful and why nominees should strive to be above reproach this should be one of the toughest job interviews because the stakes are that high..
dem	the stakes are always high when this chamber votes to confirm any president supreme court nominee as they should be this is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in our land those that serve on the court make decisions that affect the lives of millions of americans
dem	brett kavanaugh is not on trial for misconduct in his youth he has interviewing for a job as a supreme court justice kavanaugh perjured himself that is disqualifying here are just some of his lies
dem	this is not over i am going to keep fighting against this dangerous nomination and i know you will join me in making your voices heard there has too much at stake to give up now
dem	kavanaugh was involved in discussions about surveillance in direct contradiction to his testimony to the judiciary committee brett kavanaugh has gone to such great lengths to hide his views and lie about his record on crucial fourth amendment issues
dem	this is not over yet though the republican leadership is dead set on jamming this nomination through we must keep speaking up for what is right the stakes are too high to be silent pm
dem	justice stevens is right temperament matters judge kavanaugh made partisan statements last week that i never thought i would hear from a nominee seeking a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land
dem	i saw the fbi report and it is very clear that senate republican leaders andamp president trump did not allow a full and thorough investigation this was rigged from the start to protect judge kavanaugh
dem	we can not and we should not rush to confirm a man to a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land under such a dark cloud of credible allegations
dem	i have read the fbi report dr. ford was not interviewed dozens of people who know dr. ford ms. ramirez and brett kavanaugh were not interviewed brett kavanaugh was not interviewed it is clear this process was never designed to inform
dem	when dr. ford is not treated with dignity and respect survivors everywhere are disrespected when senators turn their backs on survivors who simply want to be heard it sends a message to all survivors that they are not valued
dem	since the fbi report was extremely limited think about this dr. ford had nothing to gain from her brave testimony no benefit what did brett kavanaugh have to gain from categorically denying several credible allegations and lashing out at democrats a lifetime appointment
dem	judge kavanaugh through his political choices and affiliations as well as his legal and judicial writing has told us loud and clear that he does not respect a woman right to make her own intimate personal decisions
dem	then and now i worried about what judge kavanaugh confirmation would mean to the people of colorado for those with preexisting conditions who depend on the affordable care act for life-saving treatment
dem	how can anybody expect that brett kavanaugh would offer a fair hearing in a politically charged case
dem	judge kavanaugh less than truthful answers on matters large and small point to a troubling pattern and raise serious questions about his credibility
dem	on issue after issue judge kavanaugh sworn testimony was either misleading or false
dem	a bipartisan majority of senators considering judge kavanaugh testimony record credibility trustworthiness and temperament and the heartbreaking testimony of dr. ford can vote to reject his nomination and ask the president to send the senate another name
dem	based on all the factors we have before us i do not believe judge kavanaugh has earned this seat
dem	president donald trump second supreme court nominee fails to live up to his own standards of a good judge america deserves better ourview vote no on kavanaugh
dem	i can not imagine any senator seeing what we saw in that hearing watching a nominee make a display like that and thinking this person is fit to serve as an impartial judge on our nation highest court
dem	if dr. ford testimony is the truth and i believe it is then judge kavanaugh should be disqualified from serving on the supreme court
dem	patty murray time and again in his initial hearing andamp then even further in his second hearing judge kavanaugh made it clear he has serious issues with the truth
dem	in his testimony last thursday judge kavanaugh launched into a partisan political screed that contradicted everything he has ever professed to believe about the way judges should behave
dem	senator murphy trump picked judge kavanaugh to help him unwind judicially a law that he could not unwind legislatively and that will have huge consequences on folks who need insurance coverage for things like cancer addiction or mental illness
dem	it is impossible to take this investigation seriously when so many key witnesses including judge kavanaugh and dr. ford were not interviewed and constraints were imposed on what was asked and who was spoken to
dem	this process was rigged to protect judge kavanaugh andamp prevent the fbi from conducting a thorough investigation if this ends up being jammed through there will be tremendous anger andamp backlash from women andamp survivors across the country full statement
dem	republicans have declared there was not a hint of misconduct based on our briefing andamp review of documents despite a clearly restricted investigation that is not true our previous concerns about judge kavanaugh truthfulness have also not been assuaged by this investigation
dem	the me too movement forced them to open the floor to dr. ford but her testimony was never really going to matter to president trump and the republican leadership
dem	the president should lead this country in changing the culture making it easier for women to come forward and tell their stories making it clear to boys and men that in this country that type of behavior is unacceptable instead he mocked a truly courageous woman
dem	i just reviewed the fbi kavanaugh report the fbi never interviewed many relevant witnesses there are also thousands of pages of leads from the tip line that received no follow up it is clear the white house only wanted the fbi to go through the motions andamp that is what it did
dem	sen warren i believe that dr. ford credible allegations and judge kavanaugh partisan venomous rant are sufficient reasons to vote no on his nomination
dem	this incomplete investigation does a tremendous disservice to survivors who are bravely seizing this moment to tell their stories in an effort to effect much-needed and long-overdue change
dem	if i had received a report like this when i was serving as a us attorney i would have sent it back for more work clearly there were considerable constraints on the fbi and those constraints have hampered the sincere and thorough investigation we need
dem	this is a question about whether we as a country at the highest levels of power believe victims and survivors of sexual assault and are willing to listen to them to believe them and to take action
dem	if truth under oath means anything at all judge kavanaugh has disqualified himself over and over and over again
dem	the fbi report on judge kavanaugh is entirely incomplete and insufficient there are dozens of witnesses who have not been interviewed this is for a lifetime appointment the american people deserve to have all the facts
dem	chairman grassley said this partial report included no whiff of sexual misconduct i can only conclude that he purposefully skipped the interview of deborah ramirez who testified to the fbi under oath that judge kavanaugh assaulted her
dem	today i am standing with everyone marching today to oppose judge kavanaugh nomination the american people deserve better
dem	it is just a pattern a pattern of limiting access to facts limiting access to truth limiting access to what the american people ought to know
dem	not even a full week for an fbi investigation a single copy of the report given to the senate less than an hour to review this is a complete sham senate maj ldr mc connell said he would plow brett kavanaugh through and that is exactly what the gop is doing no matter the cost
dem	i can not support judge kavanaugh because of his judicial record his partisan leanings and his lack of impartiality and judicial temperament
dem	judge kavanaugh has a habit of appearing to lie under oath
dem	happening now sen schumer and sen feinstein react to the staff briefing on the fbi update to judge kavanaugh background check

dem	meanwhile many of my republican colleagues are asking why survivors do not come forward this is why this is why
dem	the me too movement has rippled throughout our society many survivors men and women alike have come forward to share heart-wrenching trauma they have endured for decades and as elected officials we have a responsibility to treat survivors with compassion believe survivors
dem	president trump mocking of dr. ford is offensive dr. ford bravely came forward to recount being sexually assaulted she deserves to be heard and respected not mocked
dem	dr. ford compelling and sincere testimony before the senate judiciary committee helped prompt this fbi investigation by not interviewing her the fbi is shortchanging their own investigation
dem	junk plans are exactly that junk these healthcare plans allow insurance companies to hike up costs if you have pre-existing conditions or deny you altogether joining with senator baldwin to force a vote to roll back these junk plans and protect your coverage
dem	i am joining senator baldwin andamp my senate dems colleagues in an effort to overturn the trump admin expansion of junkplans that would turn back the clock on health care with this discharge petition we can force a vote on the senate floor to say no to junk plans ron report

dem	yesterday judge kavanaugh falsely claimed over and over again that every other person dr. ford placed in that house said the assault did not happen that is just not true and we know it is not
dem	time and time again when confronted under oath with questions about his involvement in bush-era scandals or controversial matters judge kavanaugh misled the senate
dem	flake what i do know is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused absent corroborating evidence once again any lack of corroboration is wholly the responsibility of rs who stifled the bi by the fbi into all claims of sexual assault
dem	setting a vote on kavanaugh less than hours after yesterday testimony shows what a sham this process has been i just refused to vote and walked out
dem	judge kavanaugh meltdown was the angriest and most partisan performance a supreme court nominee has ever delivered how can the public ever have confidence that he would judge impartially on controversial issues that come before the court

dem	this is not a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations while the republican strategy is no longer attack the victim it is ignore the victim
dem	just yesterday republicans and judge kavanaugh touted the american bar association now that the aba is calling for an impartial fbi investigation before kavanaugh is confirmed to a lifetime position on supreme court will they ignore them

dem	the american people deserve to know the facts- that means a full fbi investigation of every allegation against kavanaugh for republican leaders to call a vote w/o that investigation just hours after a heart-wrenching hearing says everything about who they believe matters
dem	it is a travesty that the committee is planning to move forward without an fbi investigation and without hearing from mark judge or other witnesses or other accusers
dem	senator durbin question on dr. blasey ford certainty that brett kavanaugh was her attacker could not be clearer and her answer leaves no room for doubt
dem	we should hear what these witnesses have to say for themselves publicly before the senate judiciary committee about what they remember of the summer of in their own words right now we are missing this critical information
dem	one of the four witnesses judge kavanaugh kept on referring to as exonerating leland keyser has said publicly that she believes dr. blasey ford
dem	judge kavanaugh kept repeating that four witnesses swore that dr. blasey ford account did not happen not true all we have are statements from their lawyers claiming that they have no knowledge of the night in question that is not the same thing as it did not happen
dem	republicans desperate attempt to distract from dr. blasey ford powerful testimony by blaming democrats is refuted by her own words all sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public
dem	without a thorough independent investigation there will be a cloud over this process and this nominee that will damage one of our country most vital institutions the supreme court
dem	women across the country are making their voices heard andamp demanding change when it comes to the treatment of women and sexual assault survivors while i believe dr. ford it is in the best interest of the american people for these allegations to be fully investigated by the fbi
dem	dr. ford testimony was detailed moving and credible and i believe her i was in awe of her bravery and strength today i hope her testimony will be a watershed moment in our country for survivors of sexual assault
dem	senator leahy asked dr. blasey ford what stood out the most from her memory of the incident involving brett kavanaugh her answer is one everyone should listen to
dem	the senate advice and consent process to evaluate supreme court nominees is a job interview not a criminal trial there is no entitlement to a seat on the supreme court brett kavanaugh character credibility and candor matter
dem	we must halt these proceedings not just for the integrity of scotus but to work toward a culture where survivors of sexual violence know they will be heard supported andamp respected if potus will not call for an fbi investigation he should withdraw judge kavanaugh nomination
dem	i watched today sen judiciary hearing i listened intently to dr. christine blasey ford harrowing testimony i believe her it is outrageous that senate gop is moving forward with a vote tomorrow the vote must be canceled
dem	the american bar association does not make decisions like this lightly a neutral professional fbi investigation is our best path forward on the kavanaugh nomination
dem	the way to make this inquiry truly credible is to do what we have always done when new information about a nominee comes to light ask the fbi to investigate senator leahy
dem	today judge kavanaugh failed his own test with brazen partisan commentary and outlandish conspiracy theories
dem	dr. ford with what degree of certainty do you believe brett kavanaugh assaulted you dr. ford
dem	the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense dr. ford answering a question from senator leahy about her strongest memory of the incident
dem	i listened to dr. ford and judge kavanaugh i believe dr. ford brett kavanaugh does not belong on the supreme court if judge kavanaugh wants to clear his name of these serious charges he should demand an fbi investigation if not the senate must reject his nomination
dem	judge kavanaugh should withdraw immediately if gop leaders continue to rush this nomination women andamp men across the country will stand up andamp fight back the senate failed anita hill andamp all women in years later we must do better press release
dem	i commend dr. ford for her courage under incredibly difficult circumstances today she has requested an fbi investigation my republican colleagues said they need more information there is a simple solution here and it is not to rush through a lifetime appointment
dem	i asked kavanaugh whether like dr. ford he had taken a polygraph whether he would call for an fbi investigation into the allegations and whether he watched dr. ford testimony none of his answers were yes
dem	time and time again we asked judge kavanaugh to support an fbi investigation into the allegations against him time and time again he refused
dem	if our republican colleagues are so certain of judge kavanaugh story they should immediately demand that the white house order the fbi to reopen the background investigation and hold off on a vote for several days so all the facts can come out
dem	while i strongly believe dr. ford the way to clear this up would be to have the fbi reopen the investigation actually interview potential witnesses and get to the truth before the senate is required to vote on whether to elevate judge kavanaugh to the supreme court
dem	dr. ford testimony was courageous difficult to hear and grounded in the facts judge kavanaugh was angry defiant and partisan
dem	one way for brett kavanaugh to clear his name is to submit to an fbi investigation but he refuses and he will not release the thousands of documents from his gov't service what is he hiding a justice should have honesty andamp integrity kavanaugh has neither he should withdraw
dem	dr. ford showed great strength and courage in painting for the nation the long-lasting impacts of sexual assault
dem	the senate should not move forward on the kavanaugh nomination dr. ford strong testimony should be enough to stop any further votes before a complete nonpartisan investigation takes place
dem	tune in as gillibrand ny stands with rep annie kuster and other survivors of sexual assault and harassment as they share their stories
dem	the clear contrast between these two witnesses one composed individual who gave thorough answers based on a clear recollection of her trauma and another who repeatedly dodged questions will be seared into americans memories for generations
dem	brett kavanaugh testimony demonstrated he lacks both the judgment and the temperament americans expect from a scotus justice the best that can be said of his testimony is that it was strikingly evasive
dem	dr. ford brave testimony today gave hope to survivors everywhere i can not imagine a more compelling witness i believe christine blasey ford
dem	my final question for judge kavanaugh did you watch dr. ford testimony his answer i did not
dem	dr. ford courage is inspiring and i am very grateful to her for coming forward to tell her story even in the face of deep personal cost she was moving heartfelt and honest
dem	in judge kavanaugh initial hearings he showed a lack of truthfulness on a range of issues today testimony only reinforced my questions about his credibility the senate should halt this confirmation process and there should be an fbi investigation
dem	i watched the anita hill hearings in at home with my daughter and it made me want to run for senate years later i am watching from my office in the senate some things have changed some things remain the same -pm
dem	republicans righteous indignation over how judiciary dems handled dr. ford allegations completely misses the point the question is not whether we agree on process clearly we do not the question is whether we believe dr. ford clearly they do not kavanaugh hearings
dem	senator durbin asked judge kavanaugh if he would support an fbi investigation to clear his name he refused to answer

dem	i questioned judge kavanaugh repeatedly on whether he would ask for an impartial fbi investigation into the allegations against him he declined repeatedly

dem	i have been watching today hearing closely i believe dr. blasey ford
dem	as senators we must take our constitutional role to advise andamp consent seriously this is about confirming judge kavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the highest court my fellow senators all must ask ourselves what kind of country we want our children andamp grandchildren living in
dem	dr. ford has bravely shared her credible andamp powerful testimony the hearing so far has shown important things we must respect the stories of brave women coming forward and that the confirmation process for judge kavanaugh must be halted andamp his fbi background check reopened

dem	dr. ford was so brave this morning and i was so proud of the message of hope and inspiration that she sent to all sexual assault survivors we are here for you we will support you we will listen to you and we will believe you pm believe survivors
dem	when i watched the anita hill hearings in '91 i did not see anyone asking the questions i would ask this morning i saw a dem side that looked and sounded like our country asking dr. ford respectful questions and gop men hiding behind a hired prosecutor cross-examining her pm
dem	today while rejecting an fbi investigation republicans are refusing to hear testimony from any other witness including mark judge who dr. ford identified as being in the room during the attack judge should be subpoenaed so the committee can hear from him directly
dem	happening now judge kavanaugh answers questions from members of the senate judiciary committee
dem	what i find most inexcusable is this rush to judgment the unwillingness to take these kinds of allegations at face value and look at them for what they are a real question of character for someone who is asking for a lifetime appointment on the supreme court
dem	thank you dr. ford your bravery and poise as you told your story have touched millions across this country i hear you and i believe you
dem	dr. christine blasey ford is forcing us to look the question square in the face does character matter i believe it does and i believe the reaction we have seen to dr. blasey ford courage shows us that we are not alone
dem	never in the history of background investigations has an investigation not been pursued when new credible derogatory information was brought forward about the nominee or the candidate it is a grave disservice to dr. ford
dem	here is the quote from sen. graham in about his prosecution of rape cases referenced during my questioning
dem	the judiciary committee is not a court of law our job is not to put dr. blasey ford on trial our job is to evaluate the credibility and character of brett kavanaugh and decide if he should be one of nine people to serve on the highest court in the land
dem	dr. ford is credible and persuasive she is also unbelievably brave until i heard her talking about what she experienced i did not fully appreciate the terror she felt in that moment the horror of the physical assault and the psychological trauma of believing she might die
dem	dr. ford has been amazing she is an inspiration and source of strength to every survivor
dem	dr. ford has shown remarkable courage in coming forward having clearly understood the vile threats and criticisms she and her family would face i call on my senate gop colleagues to now meet her courage with their own kavanaugh hearings
dem	i believe dr. ford believe women
dem	asked why she agonized so long over whether to come forward dr. ford replied i was calculating daily the risk and wondering whether i would just be jumping in front of a train that was headed to where it was headed anyway and that i would just be personally annihilated
dem	dr. ford testimony today is heartbreaking credible and compelling anyone watching can have no doubt she is telling the truth i believe her and i hope my republican colleagues do too
dem	watch as dr. blasey ford bravely shares her story andamp answers my questions about her allegations against judge kavanaugh
dem	i am sorry for what this has done to dr. ford and her family no one should face harassment death threats and disparaging comments by cheap shot politicians simply for telling the truth
dem	dr. ford courage in coming forward has given countless americans the strength to face their own life-shattering past andamp begin to heal their wounds by example she brought many families into honest andamp sometimes painful dialogue that should have occurred a long time ago
dem	we are here for one reason to determine whether judge kavanaugh should be elevated to one of the most powerful positions in our country this is not a trial of dr. ford it is a job interview for judge kavanaugh is he the best we can do
dem	chairman grassley criticized sen. feinstein for mentioning deborah ramirez julie swetnick andamp other allegations against judge kavanaugh he said we will deal with those later if the vote is tomorrow when is later

dem	no one is asking the fbi to reach conclusions regarding the kavanaugh sexual battery allegations what we are asking is for the facts which the fbi is uniquely suited to collect republicans repeatedly refused to ask the fbi do its job
dem	i believe dr. christine blasey ford
dem	sen. grassley the judiciary committee knew of the allegations that professor hill had made against judge thomas these claims were taken seriously by having the federal bureau of investigation launch an inquiry to determine their validity congr record 10/24/91
dem	refusing to honor dr. ford request that the fbi reopen kavanaugh background investigation senjudiciary instead issued a take it or leave it ultimatum to testify without the benefit of a single outside witness or any sincere effort to obtain corroborating evidence
dem	before anita hill testified in '91 senjudiciary called for an fbi investigation into her allegations against clarence thomas at the time senorrinhatch called it the very right thing to do this is a routine step when new relevant info about a nominee comes to light
dem	this hearing is an important step but it can not be the last one two other women want to come testify to share their experiences and there must be investigation and additional hearings -pm believe survivors
dem	fact-check the judiciary committee has never investigated allegations like dr. blasey ford on its own that has always been the fbi job investigations should not be done by partisan republican staff
dem	one thing comes to mind when i think of dr. christine blasey ford courage she did not ask for this burden she did not want this spotlight or the death threats andamp fear that have come with it but she has about to testify before the senate anyway andamp i thank her for doing so
dem	i am here today not because i want to be i am terrified i am here because i believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while brett kavanaugh and i were in high school
dem	today we need to remember dr. christine blasey ford and the others who have come forward have done so with incredible courage fully knowing that their character would be attacked and terrible things said about them their lives will never be the same we owe them our respect
dem	if there are serious questions about a nominee fitness for the office we should give the benefit of the doubt to the american people and protect the integrity of supreme court
dem	republicans did not learn from the mistakes of the anita hill hearing and are making new ones blocking an fbi investigation no outside witnesses having a prosecutor cross examine dr. blasey ford and scheduling a vote before her testimony are among their bad decisions
dem	graham when a woman says something she needs to be heard but when you accuse someone of a crime the accuser needs to be tested how tested by investigation but fbi has not investigated no subpoena for witness allegedly on scene who has gone into hiding
dem	if the republicans believe these two men they should call both of them to testify and refer their names to the montgomery county district attorney if they do not we will know it is just an attempt to undermine dr. ford and plow right through with the nomination
dem	these hearings are supposed to be kavanaugh job interview but republicans are turning it into a kangaroo court show trial of dr. ford appears that no measure of decency shame or justice will interfere with their determination to railroad this nominee through apparently

dem	it is becoming pretty clear that judge kavanaugh background needs a closer look if we are serious about the truth the president should direct the fbi to reopen its background check on this nominee

dem	this is what plowing right through this looks like how can you schedule a vote with no investigation and before dr. ford has shared her story it is clear senate gop does not care about serious allegations of sexual assault and will stop at nothing to confirm kavanaugh
dem	we need your voices now more than ever to let women and men around the country know that we believe survivors
dem	republicans have hired an outside attorney to grill dr. ford they have scheduled a vote on judge kavanaugh for friday am the day after this hearing and they are limiting questions to round of min qs does that sound like they are taking this seriously to you me neither
dem	as former chairman of the judiciary committee i would never schedule a vote before we hear critical testimony that speaks to a nominee fitness for scotus for a lifetime appt rs are rendering a verdict before the hg as shameful as it is shameless
dem	this rush to judgment betrays any pretense of listening respectfully andamp honestly to a credible courageous sexual assault survivor it is an insult to the entire survivor community
dem	the message is clear serious credible allegations of sexual assault matter very little to my republican colleagues when putting extremist ideologues on the federal bench
dem	scheduling a vote even before hearing dr. blasey ford testimony senate republicans have demonstrated the disrespect andamp disregard that all too frequently shames andamp silences survivors from ever coming forward
dem	that is hours after we hear testimony from dr. blasey ford and judge kavanaugh clearly republicans meant it when they said they wanted to plow right through on this nomination regardless of what happens on thursday
dem	republicans just announced a committee vote on kavanaugh at am on friday less than hours after thursday hearing ends this means little to no chance for the american people to contact them and weigh in this is a sham
dem	for republicans to schedule a friday vote on kavanaugh today days before dr. blasey ford has had a chance to tell her story is outrageous first republicans demanded dr. blasey ford testify immediately now they do not even need to hear her before they move ahead with a vote
dem	plow right through that is what republican leaders want to do with judge kavanaugh nomination even though serious and credible allegations of sexual misconduct have been brought forward republicans want to rush this vote through asap
dem	despite all the calls for fairness over and over again by senator mc connell fairness would dictate that the fbi do an impartial investigation of the sexual assault allegations against judge kavanaugh and present their conclusions whatever they may be
dem	senate gop has abandoned even a pretense of treating dr ford credible allegations seriously declaring a political victory w/o yet hearing a single minute of testimony this anita hill redux is a profound insult to her andamp all survivors of sexual violence
dem	president trump is once again attacking a woman who bravely shared her story of sexual assault these serious allegations should be thoroughly investigated by the fbi not diminished and attacked

dem	president trump andamp some senate gop want to jam judge kavanaugh onto the supreme court no matter what he has done andamp w/out all the facts this is not a box to check women andamp their experiences are not things to be plowed through women and all survivors should be heard andamp respected
dem	republicans are already talking about rushing to a vote before we even got to this hearing before there is an investigation and while women are sharing more stories it is disgusting it is disgraceful and women across the country are paying attention believe survivors

dem	dr. blasey ford is not on trial this hearing is to determine whether kavanaugh is qualified to sit on the supreme court by hiring a private attorney to cross-examine dr. blasey ford republicans are trying to intimidate her and avoid being held accountable by voters
dem	i disagree with senate gop decision to have an outside female counsel question dr. ford this is not a criminal trial we are determining whether judge kavanaugh fit to sit on scotus in a lifetime appointment that is why the fbi needs to reopen the background investigation
dem	i have reviewed judge kavanaugh court rulings some of his writings andamp watched his confirmation hearing it is clear his judicial philosophy is extreme my fight has always been about protecting women reproductive freedoms andamp i have serious concerns he will roll back roe v wade
dem	the allegations against judge kavanaugh are very serious that is why my colleagues andamp i have been clear we need to reopen the fbi background investigation only then once we have that information before us can we have a fair andamp open hearing watch my interview w/ wolfblitzer

dem	this is as cynical as politics get in washington stop kavanaugh
dem	dr. christine blasey ford and deborah ramirez have risked their lives to come forward and tell their stories republican senators their staff and the trump administration must stop disparaging these brave women and treat them with respect
dem	if brett kavanaugh refuses to withdraw from consideration for the supreme court following these two very serious allegations of sexual assault then the senate judiciary committee must postpone any votes on his nomination until a full and fair investigation is conducted
dem	the senate has a constitutional obligation to fully vet judge kavanaugh it is egregious that there still has not been an fbi investigation into the serious claims brought against him sen feinstein is right to call for hearing postponement to get to the bottom of these allegations
dem	we should not be voting this week or anytime in the near future until we know the truth behind the multiple sexual assault allegations against kavanagh this is highly irresponsible and reckless leadership from mc connell
dem	both dr. ford andamp ms. ramirez have said they are willing to provide their accounts to the fbi under oath anyone who is disputing their accounts should also be willing to do so under oath the nomination process should not move forward until the fbi investigates these allegations
dem	there is only one way to get to the bottom of these allegations against judge kavanaugh and prevent the nation from being thrown into further turmoil an independent background check investigation by the fbi watch sen schumer take to the senate floor
dem	the senate should halt all proceedings on judge kavanaugh nomination until a full and independent background investigation has been conducted by the fbi into the serious allegations against him
dem	given the serious and credible assault allegations against him the fbi must reopen kavanaugh background investigation republicans plan to rush his nomination for a lifetime seat before a simple investigation has been conducted is a farce
dem	it is amazing to see so many women and men here in dc and across the country expressing solidarity with dr. ford and everyone sharing sexual assault experiences believe survivors
dem	today i stand with women who are brave enough to come forward with their stories of abuse and mistreatment they deserve to be heard and credible allegations must be investigated we must believe survivors not bully them believe survivors
dem	we need your voices loud and clear now more than ever believe survivors this should not be radical this should not be controversial it should be common sense because when someone like dr. ford shares her experience she should be believed

dem	proud to join the yale law sit-in today to demand judge kavanaugh sexual assault allegations be fully investigated before the senate votes on this nominee
dem	i support sen feinstein request to delay the kavanagh hearing until the very serious and credible allegations against him are investigated by the fbi there is no rush and if there has nothing to hide senate republicans should be encouraging a thorough investigation as well
dem	the fbi needs to investigate the multiple allegations of sexual assault against judge kavanaugh this is a lifetime appointment to the supreme court the senate must get this right and take these grave and credible allegations seriously
dem	chuck grassley these mounting allegations are too serious to ignore we must know the facts before moving forward it is past time to request an fbi investigation just as we have always done when new derogatory info is uncovered about a nominee
dem	there is only one way to get to the bottom of these allegations against judge kavanaugh and prevent the nation from being thrown into further turmoil an independent background check investigation by the fbi
dem	if president trump and senate republicans are so certain the allegations against judge kavanaugh are not true then why are they blocking the fbi from reopening the background check and investigating a routine practice for judicial nominees what are they hiding
dem	it is time to set aside partisanship and for all senators to join together and acknowledge that this individual is not the right person to serve on the highest court of the land
dem	i call upon brett kavanaugh for the good of the country and the integrity of the court to step aside immediately
dem	the additional information provided by ms. ramirez regarding kavanaugh behavior in college presents a pattern of conduct that makes it absolutely clear that he is entirely unsuited to serve on the supreme court
dem	thursday hearing should be canceled in light of a disturbing new allegation of sexual misconduct against brett kavanaugh the fbi must investigate all allegations
dem	the courage deborah ramirez and dr. christine blasey ford have shown is remarkable their treatment by republicans and right wing pundits is despicable these brave women deserve an fbi investigation a pause on the nomination process and basic respect
dem	if brett kavanaugh refuses to withdraw then at the very least we can not move forward until there is a complete and thorough investigation of what appears to be a disturbing pattern of behavior by this nominee
dem	what we need is a non-partisan investigation into the facts and information which could help the judiciary committee members and others understand exactly what transpired we need to get this right
dem	if republicans have blocked an fbi investigation bullied dr. ford andamp tried to plow right through andamp put brett kavanaugh on the supreme court all while holding onto credible information about a second sexual misconduct claim then this is not a confirmation it is a cover-up
dem	debbie ramirez came forward to share her story even after seeing the nightmare of public shaming character assassination andamp threats to personal safety endured by dr. blasey ford she is incredibly brave to face a near certainty of similar attacks
dem	the senate simply can not in good conscience vote on this nomination without a full fair fbi investigation of all these allegations andamp an opportunity for these sexual assault survivors to be heard
dem	that is a highly irresponsible response to serious allegations of sexual misconduct we are considering a lifetime appointment to the supreme court it is critical that ms. ramirez allegations are investigated by the fbi andamp i thank her for the courage she has shown by coming fwd
dem	all senators have an obligation to honestly evaluate the serious allegations against judge kavanaugh why are republicans refusing to do it
dem	senate gop andamp potus need to do right by dr. ford right now they are sending the wrong message to women we must not contribute to the culture of fear we must build a culture where women feel safe telling their stories bullying brave women who come forward does the opposite
dem	the republican proposal to shirk responsibility and avoid accountability by hiring private counsel to question dr. blasey ford is shameful and their attempt to deny us the right to question is wrong private attorneys do not represent the american people we do
dem	americans are closely watching how dr. blasey ford is treated in this moment reflects upon how seriously our nation treats credible claims of sexual assault and whether we have learned from past mistakes
dem	suggesting an attack is only real if immediately reported to police demonstrates sheer ignorance for how trauma unfolds for victims repeat after me sexual assault is traumatic to relive and retell no one especially not donald j. trump should judge dr. ford timing
dem	republicans fear how they would look questioning dr. blasey ford themselves so now they are looking for a female lawyer to hide behind shame
dem	i am glad to hear this yesterday i led a letter with all judiciary democrats asking the fbi to investigate these threats it already takes tremendous courage for victims to come forward we must never tolerate such appalling harassment and intimidation
dem	fact more than of sexual assaults are not reported to the police president trump before you spew your thoughts about survivors experiences you should talk to these brave women andamp men andamp truly listen
dem	yesterday lindsey shared with me her powerful painful story about sexual assault like many survivors she did not press charges but is now using her voice to help support the in women who have also experienced sexual violence here is what she said
dem	we need to believe survivors andamp respect how andamp when they decide to share their stories if you or a loved one has experienced sexual assault andamp needs support please contact 656-hope
dem	dr. blasey ford had the courage to speak out knowing that there are those who would try to shame intimidate andamp threaten her it is sad but not surprising that she has been met with an utter lack of decency by elected leaders of this country she and all survivors deserve better
dem	the president instinct to attack women and victims of assault was on display again today of sexual assault victims do not report their attack to police for a range of reasons fear of retaliation shame and belief the police will not take them seriously
dem	dr. blasey ford has seen her worst fears come true she has receiving death threats and has been forced to leave her home it is time to stop blaming the victim and treat these allegations with the seriousness and respect they deserve
dem	when the president of the united states is already attacking dr. ford before she has even testified i am very concerned that senate is headed for an even worse and less fair process than anita hill hearings -pm
dem	when women make the difficult decision to come forward to share their experience of being sexually assaulted they should be listened to and believed not dismissed questioned and attacked by the president or anyone else -pm
dem	this is kind of attack on a victim is why so many do not report their assaults with his disgusting comments the president is perpetuating a culture that fails to take these allegations seriously and discourages victims from coming forward
dem	this is exactly why dr. ford did not want to come forward she has been subjected to death threats had to re-locate her family andamp now the president is attacking her this is not how to establish a culture in which people feel comfortable sharing their me too stories
dem	wrong again real donald trump many many victims delay disclosure of sexual assault due to the sheer trauma instead of resorting to the same bogus arguments used against anita hill how abt asking fbi to invest as pres g.h.w bush did clarence thomas
dem	this is why the president should be relying on the advice of intelligence and law enforcement professionals not cable news hosts
dem	leahy and other senators expand lawsuit for hidden kavanaugh documents to include the department of justice
dem	these comments reflect exactly why it is so hard for survivors of sexual assault to come forward society has doubted diminished and attacked survivors president trump is part of the problem carrying out the same painful attacks trying to shame and marginalize dr. ford
dem	the president tweet is disturbing this is why survivors of sexual violence fear coming forward they will be called liars dismissed andamp discredited potus should put down his phone andamp call for an fbi investigation if he really wants to get to the bottom of prof ford allegations
dem	mr. president according to the justice department even today out of sexual assaults are not reported
dem	this is unacceptable and beneath the presidency of the united states for generations women have been reluctant or afraid to speak out about their experiences because so often they have been dismissed accused of lying or even attacked
dem	it is sick and it is sad how some elected officials and members of the media are blaming and shaming dr. ford for coming forward with her story about kavanaugh women who speak out about trauma deserve our respect not our disdain it takes courage to come out and say what happened
dem	from the founding of this nation the influence of latinos has been made has been felt and continues to make us a stronger greater america sen booker hispanic heritage month
dem	a highly offensive misunderstanding of surviving trauma 1000s andamp 1000s of strong women have kept being assaulted to themselves for a variety of understandable reasons the president does not even try to understand trauma survivors he would rather use their pain for political purposes
dem	dr. ford who is in hiding andamp facing death threats has spoken clearly and she should be believed there is no reason for republicans to attack her for reasonably requesting a basic level of fair treatment andamp human decency this hearing should be delayed
dem	today i sat down with leaders at ywca chicago for an important discussion about the challenges faced by sexual assault survivors and the need to listen to support and believe survivors when they choose to come forward with their stories

rep	a bipartisan majority voted tonight to ensure care is given to infants who survive botched abortions sadly a minority of senators justified blocking the bill by saying it limits access to abortions which is not true it is about babies who are born alive andamp deserve protection
rep	today we had an opportunity to categorically reject infanticide by ensuring that the laws we have preventing this abhorrent practice are meaningfully enforced i am disappointed my senate colleagues chose partisanship over protecting newborns watch my full floor speech here
rep	tonight senate dems rejected the born alive abortion survivors protection act to see this measure get blocked is incomprehensible i will not stop working to ensure abortion survivors born children receive medical care and i will continue to protect life at all stages
rep	today i voted for the born-alive abortion survivors protection act i am disappointed my colleagues could not agree that all newborn children deserve support and care my full statement
rep	whether by neglect or intentional means or for any purpose terminating the life of a child who has been born alive is abhorrent
rep	more than a million americans have fought and died for our inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness today vote to protect a baby born alive is an unfortunate reminder that we will need to keep fighting for the most basic of those rights life
rep	i am extremely disappointed that democrats once again blocked the born-alive abortion survivors protection act every baby deserves a chance to survive and should receive appropriate medical care
rep	tonight i voted for sen sasse born-alive abortion survivors protection act which i cosponsored i am disappointed the bill did not advance because it would ensure all infants who are born alive receive appropriate medical care born alive act
rep	bill to protect abortion survivors should not be a partisan issue
rep	today the senate will vote on a bill that requires docs to care for a baby that is born alive i am proud to co-sponsor this leg but sad for our country that this even requires a vote most dems have signaled they will vote no it is hard to even comprehend their opposition
rep	as a lifelong pro-life advocate i believe in the value of every human life proud to cosponsor this straight-forward legislation andamp look forward to supporting it on the senate floor later today
rep	if we as a nation are to hold any claim to a moral character that deserves to be admired andamp emulated we must be willing to say that the lives of newborn children have inherent value andamp are worth protecting that is why i support the born-alive abortion survivors protection act
rep	instead we should promote innovation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions promising new technologies like advanced nuclear power carbon capture andamp carbon utilization hold the key to significant emissions reductions we can lower emissions without crashing the economy
rep	"the green new deal would cost every household up to 65,300 per year the total price tag would be trillion over years that is roughly four times the value of all fortune companies combined"
rep	today the senate will vote on the born-alive abortion survivors protection act the legislation is simple when a botched abortion results in the birth of a live baby that baby gets the same degree of care that any other newborn would be given
rep	the aaf analysis shows that the green new deal would bankrupt the nation

rep	"800,000 federal employees are continuing to go unpaid i support this solution to fully fund border security and reopen the government no is not a solution speaker pelosi and sen schumer should stop opposing re-opening our government and securing our border"
rep	this is the latest and most significant step yet of potus showing his willingness to negotiate and compromise with democrats on the issue of wall funding at this point if democrats refuse to come to the table it will show they are not at all serious about solving this impasse
rep	president trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government the moment now turns to nancy pelosi and chuck schumer the country is watching
