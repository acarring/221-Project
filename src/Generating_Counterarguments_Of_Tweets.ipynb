First, it loads the BERT tf hub module again (this time to extract the computation graph). Next, it creates a single new layer that will be trained to adapt BERT to our sentiment task (i.e. classifying whether a movie review is positive or negative). This strategy of using a mostly trained model is called [fine-tuning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Fine_tuning)."
